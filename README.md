# D3-Challenge

Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau, I created an intriguing D3 scatter plot with two of the various data variables in the data set to show the relationship between income and obesity rates in each state and D.C.

## About the Data

The data set stems from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that can be accessed here: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data is based on 2014 ACS one-year estimates, which includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, healthcare,etc. by state.
