            Link between Income Levels and Obesity Rates</h2>
          <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> The Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention, the American Diabeties Association (ADA) and other health officials
            are calling for immediate action to stem the tide of the growing obesity epidemic in the country. According
            to recent data from the US Census Bureau, people in the US
            who reside in lower income states are more prone to obesity. Mississippi, West Virginia,
            Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and South Carolina
            are all in the top 10 poorest and most obese states.
          </p>

          <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Although health officials caution that
            income is only one factor related to a state's obesity rate, they highlight
            that the census data is consistent with many recent studies that reveal a link between poverty and so-called
            “food deserts” – counties that have poor access to
            affordable, healthy nutrition. The ADA have proposed that states and cities consider providing tax
            breaks and other subsidies to grocers and other food purveyors
            to incentivize them to open stores in impovershied areas.</p>

          <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> The American Medical Association (AMA) also
            emphasize that public recreation awareness and funding can play
            an important role in chipping away at obesity rates. Jane Doe, Dircetor of the Obesity Action Committee at the AMA, says
            that
            “it all comes down to physical activity and nutrition – areas of the country with lower levels of
            income and higher poverty rates need more parks, bicyle paths, public gyms,
            as well as more affordable nutritional options and less fast-food restaurants.” </p>
